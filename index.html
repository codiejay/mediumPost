                 familiar scent of your 
                surroundings and that of your pet. Something is odd though, the house is 
                in order and the furniture is just the way
                 you arranged it before you left home. How come? How come the dog did 
                 not destroy the furniture arrangement as usual?

                <b>That’s</b> because she has had enough physical activity for her muscle. 
                She runs to you, tails high and wagging, body showing every evidence 
                of willingness to engage with her favourite human, You. She leans to you,
                 raises her backsides to the air, with her chest to the ground, welcoming
                  you home with an invitation to play and 
                a high pitched bark. Suddenly, all the stress of the day evaporates
                 as you run your fingers through the fur of your happy dog.

                 worried about her starving, no more. You return your gaze to her,
                  you are pleased and so is she. 
                 Her eyelids are relaxed - not too thin, 
                not too wide. She wears her ears in a relaxed fashion, not pinned back or pinned forward.

                <b>Veterinary doctors </b>recommend regular exercise for dogs. This is because 
                well exercised dogs are less likely to be bored and destructive,
                 an exercised dog is a tired dog and a tired dog is 
                 a well behaved dog. Exercise also helps dog lose weight.

                  Despite this, 57% of dog parents still admit to skipping dog walks
                   each week due to the following reasons:
